# Version for sensors PPD42NS, SDS011, DHT22, BMP180 and NEO-6M.

features:
* simultaneous operation of several sensors
* Configuration via WLAN (sensor as access point) possible
* Supports OLED displays with SSD1306
* Select the API (s) to which the data will be sent, including the ability to output the data as a CSV via USB
* usable for ESP8266 and Arduino Feather M0 (LoRa)

Todos:
* Optimizations (actually always)

The basic configuration of the parameters is done via the file `ext_dev.h`.

## WLAN configuration
see also wiki page on Github [Configuration of the sensors] (https://github.com/opendata-stuttgart/meta/wiki/Konfiguration-der-Sensoren)

If the default WLAN can not be reached after 10 seconds, an access point is set up which can be reached via "Particulate matter sensor - \ [Sensor-ID \]". After connecting to this access point, all requests should be redirected to the configuration page. Direct address of the page is http://192.168.4.1/.

Configurable are:
* Wi-Fi name and password
* Sensors to be read
* Targets for sending the data

After 5 minutes the access point should be deactivated again (does not work at the moment).


## Save as CSV

The data can be output as CSV via USB. For this purpose debug should be set to 0 both in ext_def.h and in the WLAN configuration, so that the output data is only the sensor data. When restarting the ESP8266, only a few characters will appear that represent the start state.

  Download (`DHT.cpp` and` DHT.h` and copy to the software directory)


## Connection of the sensors

When connecting sensors with 5V, please note the board version. NodeMCU v3 delivers 5V to `VU`, version 2 lacks this connector and` VIN` can be used for it.

### PPD42NS
* Pin 1 => GND
* Pin 2 => Pin D5 / GPIO14
* Pin 3 => VU
* Pin 4 => Pin D6 / GPIO12
* Pin 5 => unused

### DHT22
* Pin 1 => 3V3
* Pin 2 => pin D7 / GPIO13
* Pin 3 => unused
* Pin 4 => GND

### SDS011
* Pin 1 (TX) -> Pin D1 / GPIO5
* Pin 2 (RX) -> Pin D2 / GPIO4
* Pin 3 (GND) -> GND
* Pin 4 (2.5m) -> unused
* Pin 5 (5V) -> VU
* Pin 6 (1m) -> unused


Luftdaten.info API "Pins"
When activating multiple sensors, e.g. "simultaneously" DHT22 and PPD42NS, the API for assigning the sensor values ​​requires the specification of a pin to which the sensor (virtual) is connected.
This firmware defines the pins for the various sensors as follows:
* PPD42NS => pin 5
* DHT22 => pin 7
* SDS011 => pin 1
* BMP180 => pin 3
* BMP280 => pin 3
* BME280 => pin 11
* GPS (Neo-6M) => Pin 9


Used libraries for Adafruit Feather M0 LoRa:

To use the Adafruit Feather Boards, you must also enter the Adafruit Board Index in the Arduino IDE. In the settings the URL
https://adafruit.github.io/arduino-board-index/package_adafruit_index.json as an additional board administrator URL. After restarting the IDE, install in the board administrator "Adafruit SAMD boards".
